## Dependencies (for developers)
A lot of checks are enforced for developers via `pre-commit`. For them to work,
you'll need the following dependencies:
- `tfsec`: For static code analysis.
- `terraform-docs`: To validate documentation
- `tflint`: To lint terraform files
- `terraform`: For `terraform fmt` and `terraform validate`.
